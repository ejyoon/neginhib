	Annote = {Conducted a study which examined 2 -- 3-year-old children's spontaneous denials.  Children were shown either an object with a specific label or description, or a doll performing an action.  The experimenters then said sentences (for example,``that's the ball'', ``she's sitting'', or ``that's the yellow one'', or negative versions of similar sentences) that were either congruous with the scene or incongruous with the scene.  Results showed that while 30 -- 36 month olds responded to false affirmatives with a denial ``no'' significantly more than they did with true affirmatives, only some 24-month-olds produced ``no'' responses to false affirmatives, and 18-month-olds made almost no responses at all.  This study suggested that the spontaneous production of denial negations emerges somewhere around 2 years of age.},

	Annote = {Conducted a longitudinal study of three children, Kathryn (21-24 months), Eric(19-27 months), and Gia(19-27 months).  Found many instances of external negation in these children's speech, and interpreted these utterances as anaphoric, i.e. \cite{bloom1970, bloom1993}: \begin{center}[The child cannot connect two toy trains]\\No [I can't/don't want to,] Lois do it. \end{center}  
In addition, Bloom catalogued the types of negative utterances that the three children in her study produced, identifying three basic types that developed in the same order in each child.  The first type of negation to emerge was nonexistence, in which negation is used the refer to an object that is not perceptually present.  The second type, which emerged shortly after nonexistence, was rejection, in which negation is used to refuse or turn away some object that is present in the context.  The final type of negation to emerge in Bloom's data was denial, in which the child forms a negative utterance to make a statement about something that is false in the world around them.  Bloom's analysis was one of the first to classify children's negations into different categories in this way.  \cite{bloom1970, bloom1993}},

	Annote = {Conducted an analysis of the types of negation seen in children's early speech.  Pea's study examined 6 children from 8 to 21 months, and examined both gestural and linguistic negations produced by these children over the course of a year.  Pea identified five different categories.  Rejection was the first to emerge in Pea's sample (gestures: 10-14 months, utterances: 12-15 months).  Disappearance (negations referring to an object that has recently disappeared or an action that has recently ceased), emerged consecutively with spoken rejection (utterances: 13-15 months), followed by self-prohibition (negations used in situations where the child is engaging in an action or interacting with an object that has been forbidden in the past; gestures: 11-16 months, utterances: 14-21 months), and unfulfilled expectation (negations used in cases where an object is not in its expected location or an expected action cannot occur; gestures: 14 months, utterances: 16-18 months).  The last to develop was Truth-Functional negation, or negations used by the child in situations in which the child is engaging in an action or interacting with an object that has been forbidden in the past (utterances: 19-23 months). },

Participants responded slower to false affirmative sentences than true affirmative sentences, but responded faster to false negative sentences than true negative sentences. Most importantly, participants were overall much slower to respond either ``true'' or ``false'' when the sentence heard was a negation.},
