@article{hclark1972,
	Annote = {A sentence verification task, in which participants evaluate the truth or falsity of a sentence paired with a simple picture, to evaluate differences in how adults process negative sentences as opposed to affirmative sentences.  Collected reaction time data from adult participants who were asked to compare sentences such as ``star is above plus'' or ``star isn't above plus'' to pictures which either matched or did not match the content of the sentence.  Participants responded slower to false affirmative sentences than true affirmative sentences, but responded faster to false negative sentences than true negative sentences. Most importantly, participants were overall much slower to respond either ``true'' or ``false'' when the sentence heard was a negation.},
